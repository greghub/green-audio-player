Based on a [pen](https://codepen.io/gregh/pen/NdVvbm) I've created 2 years ago.
Due to requests from many people I decided to create a repository, 
containing an improved version of the Green Audio Player including the support for multiple audio players on a single page.

## [Online demo](https://greghub.github.io/green-audio-player/)

## Installation

#### Github

Download repository ZIP.

#### CDN

Alternatively, you can load it from CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/greghub/green-audio-player/dist/css/green-audio-player.min.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/greghub/green-audio-player/dist/js/green-audio-player.min.js"></script>
```

#### NPM

```
npm i green-audio-player
```

## Usage

Include the `green-audio-player.css` or `green-audio-player.min.css` file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{path}/dist/css/green-audio-player.min.css">
```
and `green-audio-player.js` file (or `green-audio-player.min.js`): 
```html
<script src="{path}/dist/js/green-audio-player.js"></script>
```

Add the audio tag inside of a container. You are free to add any attributes.
Green Audio Player does not change the audio tag, so for example if you want the audio to loop,
you can add the loop attribute to the audio tag.

```html
<div class="gap-example">
    <audio>
        <source src="audio/example-1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
</div>
```

This will initialize the Green Audio Player
```javascript
new GreenAudioPlayer('.gap-example');
```

You can add multiple players on a single page.

There's a shorter method for initializing several Green Audio Players:
```js
GreenAudioPlayer.init({
    selector: '.player', // inits Green Audio Player on each audio container that has class "player"
    stopOthersOnPlay: true
});
```

Refer to `/examples` folder for demos of single and multiple players.

A demo with alternate 'css' and 'svg' sources can be found under `/examples/single-instance-2.html`.
